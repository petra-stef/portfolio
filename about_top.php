      I’m a product designer in the making who is looking for new opportunities
      to articulate fresh ideas, create solutions that are effective and catered
      to the target user group, participate in pushing design boundaries and
      achieve a high standard for usability and user experience.</p>
    <p class="about_me_content2">
      Design has been the center of my world for the past year while
      switching my career from a translator to the field that I’ve always had passion for.
      Part self-taught, part formally educated,
      I learn on the go and try to enjoy this fast-moving journey to becoming a designer.</p>
